# Parallel-Processing-using-MPI
List of getting stared with MPI programs.

## What are parallel programs?
To have a parallel program that's is parallel processed means that it can run over more than one processor/core, the goal of parallel processin programs is to enhance processing time by dividing problem to be processed over several cores to work in parallel on finding the solution.

## How can we write parallel programs?
There are more than one paradiam/way/technique to write parallel programs, We will use message passing technique using MPI library.

## What is MPI?
MPI is the appreciation of 'Message Passing Interface'. it is not a new programming language, it is just a library of definations and fucntions than can be used in C language (there is another version based on FORTRAN).

So to write parallel progrmas using MPI you need to learn about a collection of definations and functions. I recommend studying from:
* [Parallel Programming with MPI] (http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Programming-MPI-Peter-Pacheco/dp/1558603395) book.
* MPI Tutorial [mpitutorial.com](http://mpitutorial.com/).
* Introduction to Parallel Programming and MPI [PDF](https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/Intro_to_MPI.pdf) Harvard University.
